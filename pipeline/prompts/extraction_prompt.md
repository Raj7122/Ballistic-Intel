## Novelty Score Guidelines

**Patents:**
- 0.9-1.0: Breakthrough innovation, novel architecture, new cryptographic method
- 0.7-0.89: Significant improvement, novel combination of existing techniques
- 0.5-0.69: Incremental improvement, optimization of existing methods
- 0.3-0.49: Minor variation, standard implementation
- 0.0-0.29: Derivative work, no meaningful innovation

**News Articles:**
- 0.8-1.0: Announces groundbreaking new product/platform/technology
- 0.6-0.79: New product with innovative features
- 0.4-0.59: Standard product/service launch
- 0.2-0.39: Funding announcement with existing product
- 0.0-0.19: Generic business news, M&A with no tech details

## Extraction Guidelines

**Company Names:**
- For **patents**: Extract from assignees (not inventors)
- For **news**: Extract from context (e.g., "Wiz announced...", "...led by Acme Corp")
- Normalize: "Wiz Security Inc." → "Wiz Security"
- Exclude: Generic terms like "Corp", "Inc", "Ltd" when standalone
- Deduplicate: "Acme" and "Acme Corp" → choose longer form

**Tech Keywords:**
- Extract specific technical terms, not generic words
- Include: Protocols, algorithms, attack types, security technologies
- Exclude: Generic business terms ("funding", "growth", "market")
- Lowercase for consistency

**Sector:**
- Choose the MOST SPECIFIC category that fits
- If multiple apply, choose primary focus
- Use "unknown" only if no clear fit

## Examples

### Example 1: Patent - Ransomware Detection

**Input:**
```
Type: patent
Title: System and method for detecting ransomware encryption behavior using machine learning
Abstract: A cybersecurity system that monitors file system activity to identify ransomware attacks in real-time. The invention uses supervised learning models trained on known ransomware samples to detect abnormal encryption patterns. When suspicious behavior is detected, the system automatically isolates affected endpoints and alerts security operations centers.
Assignee: CyberDefense Technologies Inc.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "company_names": ["CyberDefense Technologies"],
  "sector": "malware",
  "novelty_score": 0.72,
  "tech_keywords": ["ransomware", "machine learning", "behavioral detection", "endpoint isolation", "encryption patterns"],
  "rationale": ["Novel ML-based ransomware detection", "Real-time behavioral analysis", "Automated endpoint isolation"],
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
  "model_version": "v1"
}
```

### Example 2: News - Cloud Security Funding

**Input:**
```
Type: news
Title: Wiz raises $300M Series D at $10B valuation for cloud security platform
Summary: Cloud security startup Wiz announced $300 million in Series D funding co-led by Lightspeed and Greenoaks, valuing the company at $10 billion. Wiz's platform scans cloud infrastructure for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and compliance violations across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The company has grown to over 10,000 customers since launching in 2020.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "company_names": ["Wiz", "Lightspeed", "Greenoaks"],
  "sector": "cloud",
  "novelty_score": 0.35,
  "tech_keywords": ["cloud security", "misconfigurations", "vulnerability scanning", "compliance", "aws", "azure", "gcp"],
  "rationale": ["Multi-cloud security platform", "Focuses on cloud misconfigurations", "Funding announcement for existing product"],
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
  "model_version": "v1"
}
```

### Example 3: Patent - Identity Authentication

**Input:**
```
Type: patent
Title: Multi-factor authentication using behavioral biometrics and hardware tokens
Abstract: An authentication system combining traditional hardware tokens with behavioral biometric analysis including typing patterns, mouse movements, and touch pressure. The system continuously monitors user behavior post-authentication to detect account takeover attempts. Novel aspects include adaptive risk scoring that adjusts authentication requirements based on behavior deviation.

  "company_names": ["SecureID Systems"],
  "sector": "identity",
  "novelty_score": 0.78,
  "tech_keywords": ["multi-factor authentication", "behavioral biometrics", "hardware token", "continuous authentication", "risk scoring"],
  "rationale": ["Novel combination of MFA with behavioral biometrics", "Continuous post-auth monitoring", "Adaptive risk scoring mechanism"],
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
  "model_version": "v1"
}
```

### Example 4: News - Vulnerability Disclosure

**Input:**
```
Type: news
Title: Critical zero-day vulnerability discovered in Apache Log4j

The remote code execution flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers by sending specially crafted log messages. CISA has issued emergency directives and patches are being rapidly deployed.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "company_names": ["Apache", "CISA"],
  "sector": "vulnerability",

  "tech_keywords": ["zero-day", "cve", "remote code execution", "apache log4j", "vulnerability disclosure"],
  "rationale": ["Vulnerability disclosure article", "No novel technology described", "Focuses on existing security flaw"],
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
  "model_version": "v1"
}
```

## Edge Cases

- **No companies mentioned**: Return empty array `[]`
- **Ambiguous sector**: Choose primary focus or "unknown"
- **Non-technical news**: Lower novelty score, extract what's available
- **Multiple inventors but no assignee**: Return empty company array for patents

Now extract from the following item. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
